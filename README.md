# PlayZone

**PlayZone** is a collection of four interactive web-based games built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project offers a diverse gaming experience with games designed to entertain, test memory, improve typing skills, and provide a thrill of racing.

### [Live Application](https://jalajgupta15.github.io/PlayZone/)

## Games Included:
1. **Snake Game**  
   - Control a growing snake as it collects items to increase its length. Avoid colliding with the snake's body to keep playing.
   - **File**: `snake.html`
   - **Technical Highlights**: Uses JavaScript for movement and collision detection, and CSS for layout and visual representation.

2. **Memory Game**  
   - A classic card-matching game where players match pairs of cards with identical images.
   - **File**: `memory.html`
   - **Technical Highlights**: Uses JavaScript for tracking card states and matching logic, and CSS for card animations and layout.

3. **Typing Game**  
   - Test your typing speed and accuracy by typing displayed words as fast as possible.
   - **File**: `typinggame.html`
   - **Technical Highlights**: Incorporates real-time JavaScript event listeners to capture and analyze user input.

4. **Car Game**  
   - A simple driving game where the player controls a car to avoid obstacles on the road.
   - **File**: `car.html`
   - **Technical Highlights**: JavaScript handles obstacle generation, player movement, and collision detection, while CSS stylizes the game environment.

## Project Structure:
- `index.html`: The main entry point to PlayZone, serving as the game hub.
- `/assets`: Contains images, icons, and other resources used across all games.
- `/styles`: CSS files that manage the visual layout of all games.
- `/scripts`: JavaScript files that handle game logic, interactions, and user input for each game.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playzone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game menu.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For game layout and structure.
- **CSS3**: To style each game, provide animations, and enhance the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Manages game functionality, user inputs, game logic, and interactions.

## Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The games are optimized for different screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and intuitive interface to navigate through the games easily.
- **Modular Codebase**: Each game is developed as an independent module, making it easy to update or add new games in the future.

### Future Enhancements:
- Adding difficulty levels to the Snake and Car games.
- High-score tracking and leaderboard integration.
- Additional sound effects and background music for a more immersive experience.
